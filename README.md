[panflute](http://scorreia.com/software/panflute/) is a Python package that makes creating Pandoc filters fun.

For a detailed user guide, documentation, and installation instructions, see
<http://scorreia.com/software/panflute/>.
For examples that you can use as starting points, check the [examples repo](https://github.com/sergiocorreia/panflute-filters/tree/master/filters), the [sample template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sergiocorreia/panflute/master/docs/source/_static/template.py), or [this github search](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=%22import+panflute%22+OR+%22from+panflute%22+created%3A%3E2016-01-01+language%3APython+extension%3Apy&s=indexed&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93).

## Note on versions

panflute 1.12 or above dropped support of Python 2. When using Python 3, depending on your setup, you may need to use `pip3`/`python3` explicitly. If you need to use panflute in Python 2, install panflute 1.11.x or below.

Currently supported Python versions: [![Python version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/panflute.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/panflute/). Check `setup.py` for details, which further indicates support of pypy on top of CPython.

### Supported pandoc versions

pandoc versioning semantics is [MAJOR.MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH](https://pvp.haskell.org) and panflute's is MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. Below we shows matching versions of pandoc that panflute supports, in descending order. Only major version is shown as long as the minor versions doesn't matter.

<!-- For pandoc API verion, check https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pandoc for pandoc-types, which is the same thing. -->

| panflute version  | supported pandoc versions | supported pandoc API versions |
| ---   | ---   |  ---  |
| 2.0 | 2.11.0.4—2.13.x  | 1.22    |
| not supported | 2.10  | 1.21  |
| 1.12 | 2.7-2.9 | 1.17.5–1.20  |

Note: pandoc 2.10 is short lived and 2.11 has minor API changes comparing to that, mainly for fixing its shortcomings. Please avoid using pandoc 2.10.
